<div id="about">
	<h2>Bring your activities to the middle of the city with the help of a space that transforms to your needs</h2>

	<p>
	The city of Vantaa Tietohallinto's design laboratory SmartLab and Vantaan Tilakeskus
	have been designing a new type of Muuntautuvat toimitilat (\"Transforming office\") service.
	</p>

	<p>
	The idea of the service is to provide Vantaan kaupunki workers a chance to book an office space to 
	their use and customise the furniture to suit their needs. In addition, the users of Muuntamo can 
	order extra services from outside service providers. Muuntamo offers a spectacular framework for
	confluence of the city workers, municipal services and private sector service providers and of 
	course for the residents.
