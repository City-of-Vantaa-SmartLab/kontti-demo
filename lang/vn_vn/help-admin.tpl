<h1>Booked Scheduler Administration</h1>

<div id="help">
    <h2>Administration</h2>

    <p>If you are in a group with the Application Administrator role assigned then you will see the Application
        Management menu item. All
        administrative tasks can be found here.</p>

    <div id="help-schedules">
        <h3>Setting up Schedules</h3>

        <p>
            When installing Booked Scheduler a default schedule will be created with out of the box settings. From the
            Schedules menu option you can view and edit attributes of the current schedules.
        </p>

        <p>Schedules can be displayed starting on any day of the week and for any number of days. For a schedule to
            display starting on the current day, set the
            Starts On option to Today.</p>

        <p>Each schedule must have a layout defined for it. This controls the availability of the resources on that
            schedule. Clicking the Change Layout link will bring up the layout editor. Here you can create and change
            the
            time slots that are available for reservation and blocked from reservation. There is no restriction on the
            slot
            times, but you must provide slot values for all 24 hours of the day, one per line. Also, the time format
            must be
            in 24 hour time.
            You can also provide a display label for any or all slots, if you wish.</p>

        <p>A slot without a label should be formatted like this: 10:25 - 16:50</p>

        <p>A slot with a label should be formatted like this: 10:25 - 16:50 Schedule Period 4</p>

        <p>Below the slot configuration windows is a slot creation wizard. This will set up available slots at the given
            interval between the start and end times.</p>

        <h3>Schedule Administrators</h3>

        <p>A group of users may be set up with permission to manage resources. In order for a group to be set as the
            schedule administrator the group must first
            be granted the Schedule Administrator role. This is configured from the Groups admin tool. Once that role
            has been added, the group will be
            available in the Manage Schedules tool.</p>

        <p>Schedule Administrators have the same capabilities as Application Administrators for any resource that is on
            a schedule which the group is assigned
            to. They can change schedule details, black out times, manage and approve reservations.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="help-resources">
        <h3>Setting up Resources</h3>

        <p>You can view and manage resources from the Resources menu option. Here you can change the attributes and
            usage
            configuration of a resource.
        </p>

        <p>Resources in Booked Scheduler can be anything you want to make bookable, such as rooms or equipment. Every
            resource
            must be assigned to a schedule in order for it to be bookable. The resource will inherit whatever layout the
            schedule uses.</p>

        <p>Setting a minimum reservation duration will prevent booking from lasting shorter than the set amount. The
            default is
            no minimum.</p>

        <p>Setting a maximum reservation duration will prevent booking from lasting longer than the set amount. The
            default is
            no maximum.</p>

        <p>Setting a resource to require approval will place all bookings for that resource into a pending state until
            approved.
            The default is no approval required.</p>

        <p>Setting a resource to automatically grant permission to it will grant all new users permission to access the
            resource
            at registration time. The default is to automatically grant permissions.</p>

        <p>You can require a booking lead time by setting a resource to require a certain number of days/hours/minutes
            notification. For example, if it is currently 10:30 AM on a Monday and the resource requires 1 days
            notification,
            the resource will not be able to be booked until 10:30 AM on Sunday. The default is that reservations can be
            made up
            until the current time.</p>

        <p>You can prevent resources from being booked too far into the future by requiring a maximum notification of
            days/hours/minutes. For example, if it is currently 10:30 AM on a Monday and the resource cannot end more
            than 1 day
            in the future, the resource will not be able to be booked past 10:30 AM on Tuesday. The default is no
            maximum.</p>

        <p>Certain resources can have a usage capacity. For example, some conference rooms may only hold up to 8 people.
            Setting the resource capacity will prevent any more than the configured number of participants at one time,
            excluding the organizer. The default is that resources have unlimited capacity.</p>

        <p>Requiring check in/check out will give the reservation owner the opportunity to record when they actually
            begin and end a reservation. You can optionally automatically release a reserved time if a user does not
            check in within a given amount of time. To automatically release reservations you must configure the
            autorelease job.</p>

        <p>Application Administrators and applicable Schedule and Resource Administrators are exempt from usage
            constraints.</p>

        <h3>Resource Administrators</h3>

        <p>A group of users may be set up with permission to manage resources. In order for a group to be set as the
            resource administrator the group must first
            be granted the Resource Administrator role. This is configured from the Groups admin tool. Once that role
            has been added, the group will be
            available in the Manage Resources tool.</p>

        <p>Resource Administrators have the same capabilities as Application Administrators for any resource which the
            group is assigned to. They can change
            resource details, black out times, manage and approve reservations.</p>

        <h3>Resource Images</h3>

        <p>You can set a resource image which will be displayed when viewing resource details from the reservation page.
            This
            requires php_gd2 to be installed and enabled in your php.ini file. <a
                    href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.image.php" target="_blank">More
                Details</a></p>

        <div id="help-resource-statuses">
            <h3>Resource Statuses</h3>
            <p>Setting a resource to the Available status will allow users with permission to book the reservation. The
                Unavailable status will show the resource on
                the schedule but will not allow it to be booked by anyone other than administrators. The Hidden status
                will remove the resource from the schedule
                and prevent bookings from all users.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div id="help-resource-groups">
        <h3>Resource Groups</h3>

        <p>Resource Groups are a simple way to organize and filter resources. When a booking is being created, the user
            will have an option to book all
            resources in a group. If resources in a group are assigned to different schedules then only the resources
            which share a schedule will be booked
            together.</p>

        <p>If using resource groups, each resource must be assigned to at least one group. Due to the group hierarchy,
            unassigned resources will not be able to
            be reserved.</p>

        <p>Drag and drop resource groups to reorganize.</p>

        <p>Right click a resource group name for additional actions.</p>

        <p>Drag and drop resources to add them to groups.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="help-resource-types">
        <h3>Resource Types</h3>

        <p>Resource types allow resources that share a common set of attributes to be managed together. Custom
            attributes for a resource type will apply to all
            resources of that type</p>
    </div>

    <div id="help-accessories">
        <h3>Setting up Accessories</h3>

        <p>Accessories can be thought of as ancillary resources used during a reservation. Examples may be projectors or
            chairs in a
            conference room.</p>

        <p>Accessories can be viewed and managed from the Accessories menu item, under the Resources menu item. Setting
            a
            accessory quantity will prevent more than that number of accessories from being booked at a time.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="help-quotas">
        <h3>Setting up Quotas</h3>

        <p>Quotas restrict reservations from being booked based on a configurable limit. The quota system in Booked
            Scheduler is
            very flexible, allowing you to build limits based on reservation length and number reservations.</p>

        <p>Quota limits &quot;stack&quot;. For example, if a quota exists limiting a resource to 5 hours per day and
            another quota exists limiting to
            4 reservations per day, a user would be able to make 4 one-hour-long reservations but would be restricted
            from making 3
            two-hour-long reservations. This allows powerful quota combinations to be built.</p>

        <p>Quotas applied to a group are enforced for each user in the group individually. It does not apply to the
            group's aggregated reservations.</p>

        <p>It is important to remember that quota limits are enforced based on the schedule's timezone. For example, a
            daily limit would begin and end at
            midnight of the schedule's timezone; not the user's timezone.</p>

        <p>Application Administrators are exempt from quota limits.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="help-announcements">
        <h3>Setting up Announcements</h3>

        <p>Announcements are a very simple way to display notifications to Booked Scheduler users.</p>

        <p>From the Announcements menu item
            you can view and manage the announcements that are displayed on users dashboards. An announcement can be
            configured
            with an optional start and end date. An optional priority level is also available, which sorts announcements
            from 1
            to 10.</p>

        <p>HTML is allowed within the announcement text. This allows you to embed links or images from anywhere on the
            web.</p>

    </div>

    <div id="help-groups">
        <h3>Setting up Groups</h3>

        <p>Groups in Booked Scheduler organize users, control resource access permissions and define roles within the
            application. Setting resource permissions for a group will grant access to all members of that group. Users
            can individually be granted additional
            resource permission.</p>

        <h3>Roles</h3>

        <p>Roles give a group of users the authorization to perform certain actions.</p>

        <p>Application Administrator: Users that belong to a group that is given the Application Administrator role are
            open to
            full administrative privileges. This role has nearly zero restrictions on what resources can be booked. It
            can
            manage all aspects of the application.</p>

        <p>Group Administrator: Users that belong to a group that is given the Group Administrator role are able to
            manage
            their groups and reserve on behalf of and manage users within that group. A group administrator must first
            be assigned the Group Administrator role.
            This group will then be available in the Group Administrators list.</p>

        <p>Resource Administrator: Users that belong to a group that is given the Resource Administrators role have the
            same capabilities as Application
            Administrators for any resource which the group is assigned to. They can change resource details, black out
            times, manage and approve
            reservations.</p>

        <p>Schedule Administrator: Users that belong to a group that is given the Schedule Administrators role have the
            same capabilities as Application
            Administrators for any resource that is on a schedule which the group is assigned to. They can change
            schedule details, black out times, manage and
            approve reservations.</p>

    </div>

    <div id="help-reservations">
        <h3>Viewing and Managing Reservations</h3>

        <p>You can view and manage reservations from the Reservations menu item. By default you will see the last 14
            days and the
            next 14 days worth of reservations. This can be filtered more or less granular depending on what you are
            looking for.
            This tool allows you to quickly find an act on a reservation. You can also export the list of filtered
            reservations
            to CSV format for further reporting.</p>

        <h3>Reservation Approval</h3>

        <p>Setting $conf['settings']['reservation']['updates.require.approval'] to true will put all reservation
            requests into a
            pending state. The reservation becomes active only after an administrator approves it. From the Reservations
            admin
            tool an administrator will be able to view and approve pending reservations. Pending reservations will be
            highlighted.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="help-users">
        <h3>Viewing and Managing Users</h3>

        <p>You can add, view, and manage all registered users from the Users menu item. This tool allows you to change
            resource
            access permissions of individual users, assign users to groups, deactivate or delete accounts, reset user
            passwords, and edit user details.
            You can also add new users to Booked Scheduler, which is especially useful if self-registration is turned
            off.</p>

        <h3>Reservation Colors</h3>

        <p>Reservation colors can be set for individual users, resources, or dynamically based on a custom attribute
            value. The slot background color of a reservation on the Schedule and Calendar views will be
            displayed in this color.</p>

    </div>

    <div id="help-attributes">
        <h3>Custom Attributes</h3>

        <p>Custom Attributes are a powerful extension point in Booked. You can add additional attributes to
            Reservations, Resources, Resource Types and
            Users.</p>

        <p>Attributes can be configured as single line text box, a multi-line text box, a select list (drop down), or a
            checkbox. All attributes can be
            configured to be required. Textbox attributes allow an optional validation expression to be set. This value
            must be a valid regular expression. For
            example, to require a digit to be entered the validation expression would be <em>/\d+/</em></p>

        <p>User, Resource, and Resource Type attributes can be limited to a single entity. These attributes will have an
            Applies To property. If an attribute is
            configured to apply to a single entity then it will only be collected for that entity.</p>

        <p>Reservation attributes will be collected during the reservation process. To collect an attribute value only
            for
            specific users or resources, check the 'Collect In Specific Cases' option and pick the cases when the
            attribute
            should be shown.</p>

        <p>User attributes are collected when registering and updating a user's profile.</p>

        <p>Resources attributes are entered when managing resources and will be displayed when viewing resource
            details.</p>

        <p>Resource Type attributes are entered when managing resource types and will be displayed when viewing resource
            details.</p>

        <p>Admin only attributes are only shown to users who have administrative privileges over that reservation.</p>

        <p>Private attributes are only shown to the reservation owner and those users who have administrative privileges
            over that reservation.</p>

        <p>Custom attributes are available to plugins and can be used to extend the functionality of Booked.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="help-blackouts">
        <h3>Blackout Times</h3>

        <p>Blackout Times can be used to prevent reservations from being booked at certain times. This feature is
            helpful when a resource is temporarily
            unavailable or unavailable at a scheduled recurring interval. Blacked out times are not bookable by anyone,
            including administrators.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="help-reporting">
        <h3>Reporting</h3>

        <p>Reports are accessible to all application, group, resource and schedule administrators. When the currently
            logged in
            user has access to reporting features, they will see a Reports navigation item. Booked Scheduler comes with
            a set of
            Common Reports which can be viewed as a list of results, a chart, exported to CSV and printed. In addition,
            ad-hoc
            reports can be created from the Create New Report menu item. This also allows listing, charting, exporting
            and
            printing. In addition, custom reports can be saved and accessed again at a later time from the My Saved
            Reports menu
            item. Saved reports also have the ability to be emailed.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="help-credits">
        <h3>Credits</h3>

        <p>Credits allow control over a user's usage. Credits must first be enabled in the application configuration
            before they can be managed. Once enabled, administrators will have the ability to set the credit redemption
            rates for peak and off peak times. Peak times are defined per schedule.</p>

        <p>If a reservation would bring a user over their credit limit, the reservation will be rejected. Administrators
            can manage user credits when managing user details.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="help-reminders">
        <h3>Reservation Reminders</h3>

        <p>Users can request that reminder emails are send prior to the beginning or end of a reservation. In order for
            this
            feature to function, $conf['settings']['enable.email'] and
            $conf['settings']['reservation']['enable.reminders'] must
            both be set to true. Also, a scheduled task must be configured on your server to execute
            /Booked Scheduler/Jobs/sendreminders.php</p>

        <p>On Linux, a cron job can be used. The command to run is <span class="note">php</span> followed by the full
            path to
            Booked Scheduler/Jobs/sendreminders.php. The full path to sendreminders.php on this server is <span
                    class="note">{$RemindersPath}</span>
        </p>

        <p>An example cron configuration might look like: <span class="note">* * * * * php -f {$RemindersPath}</span>

    <h2>Plugins</h2>

    <p>The following components are currently pluggable:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Authentication - Who is allowed to log in</li>
        <li>Authorization - What a user can do when you are logged in</li>
        <li>Permission - What resources a user has access to</li>
        <li>Pre Reservation - What happens before a reservation is booked</li>
        <li>Post Reservation - What happens after a reservation is booked</li>
        <li>Post Registration - What happens after a new user register</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        To enable a plugin, set the value of the config setting to the name of the plugin folder. For example, to enable
        LDAP authentication, set $conf['settings']['plugins']['Authentication'] = 'Ldap';</p>

    <p>Plugins may have their own configuration files. For LDAP, rename or copy
        /plugins/Authentication/Ldap/Ldap.config.dist to /plugins/Authentication/Ldap/Ldap.config and edit all values
        that
        are applicable to your environment.</p>

    <h3>Installing Plugins</h3>

    <p>To install a new plugin copy the folder to the proper plugin directory. Then
        change either $conf['settings']['plugins']['Authentication'], $conf['settings']['plugins']['Authorization'] or
        $conf['settings']['plugins']['Permission'] in config.php to the name of that folder.</p>

    <h2>Available Label Tokens</h2>

    <p>Available tokens for reservation labels
        are {literal}{name}, {title}, {description}, {email}, {phone}, {organization}, {position}, {startdate}, {enddate} {resourcename} {participants} {invitees} {reservationAttributes}{/literal}
        . Custom attributes can be added using att with the attribute id. For example {literal}{att1}{/literal}
        Leave it blank for no label. Any combination of tokens can be used.</p>
