<div id="help">
<h2>Administration</h2>

<p>If you are in an Application Administrator role then you will see the Application Management menu item. All
	administrative tasks can be found here.</p>

<h3>Setting up Schedules</h3>

<p>
	When installing Booked Scheduler a default schedule will be created with out of the box settings. From the
	Schedules menu option you can view and edit attributes of the current schedules.
</p>

<p>Each schedule must have a layout defined for it. This controls the availability of the resources on that
	schedule. Clicking the Change Layout link will bring up the layout editor. Here you can create and change the
	time slots that are available for reservation and blocked from reservation. There is no restriction on the slot
	times, but you must provide slot values for all 24 hours of the day, one per line. Also, the time format must be
	in 24 hour time.
	You can also provide a display label for any or all slots, if you wish.</p>

<p>A slot without a label should be formatted like this: 10:25 - 16:50</p>

<p>A slot with a label should be formatted like this: 10:25 - 16:50 Schedule Period 4</p>

<p>Below the slot configuration windows is a slot creation wizard. This will set up available slots at the given
	interval between the start and end times.</p>

<h3>Setting up Resources</h3>

<p>You can view and manage resources from the Resources menu option. Here you can change the attributes and usage
	configuration of a resource.
</p>

<p>Resources in Booked Scheduler can be anything you want to make bookable, such as rooms or equipment. Every resource
	must be assigned to a schedule in order for it to be bookable. The resource will inherit whatever layout the
	schedule uses.</p>

<p>Setting a minimum reservation duration will prevent booking from lasting longer than the set amount. The default is
	no minimum.</p>

<p>Setting a maximum reservation duration will prevent booking from lasting shorter than the set amount. The default is
	no maximum.</p>

<p>Setting a resource to require approval will place all bookings for that resource into a pending state until approved.
	The default is no approval required.</p>

<p>Setting a resource to automatically grant permission to it will grant all new users permission to access the resource
	at registration time. The default is to automatically grant permissions.</p>

<p>You can require a booking lead time by setting a resource to require a certain number of days/hours/minutes
	notification. For example, if it is currently 10:30 AM on a Monday and the resource requires 1 days notification,
	the resource will not be able to be booked until 10:30 AM on Sunday. The default is that reservations can be made up
	until the current time.</p>

<p>You can prevent resources from being booked too far into the future by requiring a maximum notification of
	days/hours/minutes. For example, if it is currently 10:30 AM on a Monday and the resource cannot end more than 1 day
	in the future, the resource will bot be able to be booked past 10:30 AM on Tuesday. The default is no maximum.</p>

<p>Certain resources cannot have a usage capacity. For example, some conference rooms may only hold up to 8 people.
	Setting the resource capacity will prevent any more than the configured number of participants at one time,
	excluding the organizer. The default is that resources have unlimited capacity.</p>

<p>Application Administrators are exempt from usage constraints.</p>

<h3>Resource Images</h3>

<p>You can set a resource image which will be displayed when viewing resource details from the reservation page. This
	requires php_gd2 to be installed and enabled in your php.ini file. <a
			href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.image.php">More Details</a></p>

<h3>Setting up Accessories</h3>

<p>Accessories can be thought of as objects used during a reservation. Examples may be projectors or chairs in a
	conference room.</p>

<p>Accessories can be viewed and managed from the Accessories menu item, under the Resources menu item. Setting a
	accessory quantity will prevent more than that number of accessories from being booked at a time.</p>

<h3>Setting up Quotas</h3>

<p>Quotas prevent reservations from being booked based on a configurable limit. The quota system in Booked Scheduler is
	very flexible, allowing you to build limits based on reservation length and number reservations. Also, quota limits
	"stack". For example, if a quota exists limiting a resource to 5 hours per day and another quota exists limiting to
	4 reservations per day a user would be able to make 4 hour-long reservations but would be restricting from making 3
	two-hour-long reservations. This allows powerful quota combinations to be built.</p>

<p>Application Administrators are exempt from quota limits.</p>

<h3>Setting up Announcements</h3>

<p>Announcements are a very simple way to display notifications to Booked Scheduler users. From the Announcements menu item
	you can view and manage the announcements that are displayed on users dashboards. An announcement can be configured
	with an optional start and end date. An optional priority level is also available, which sorts announcements from 1
	to 10.</p>

<p>HTML is allows within the announcement text. This allows you to embed links or images from anywhere on the web.</p>

<h3>Setting up Groups</h3>

<p>Groups in Booked Scheduler organize users, control resource access permissions and define roles within the
	application.</p>

<h3>Roles</h3>

<p>Roles give a group of users the authorization to perform certain actions.</p>

<p>Application Administrator: Users that belong to a group that is given the Application Administrator role are open to
	full administrative privileges. This role has nearly zero restrictions on what resources can be booked. It can
	manage all aspects of the application.</p>

<p>Group Administrator: Users that belong to a group that is given the Group Administrator role are able to manage
	their groups and reserve on behalf of and manage users within that group.</p>

<p>Resource Administrator: Users that belong to a group that is given the Resource Administrator role are able to manage
	their resources and approve reservations for their resources.</p>

<p>Schedule Administrator: Users that belong to a group that is given the Schedule Administrator role are able to manage
	their schedules and resources belonging to their schedules and approve reservations on their schedules.</p>

<h3>Viewing and Managing Reservations</h3>

<p>You can view and manage reservations from the Reservations menu item. By default you will see the last 7 days and the
	next 7 days worth of reservations. This can be filtered more or less granular depending on what you are looking for.
	This tool allows you to quickly find an act on a reservation. You can also export the list of filtered reservations
	to CSV format for further reporting.</p>

<h3>Reservation Approval</h3>

<p>Setting $conf['settings']['reservation']['updates.require.approval'] to true will put all reservation requests into a
	pending state. The reservation becomes active only after an administrator approves it. From the Reservations admin
	tool an administrator will be able to view and approve pending reservations. Pending reservations will be
	highlighted.</p>

<h3>Viewing and Managing Users</h3>

<p>You can add, view, and manage all registered users from the Users menu item. This tool allows you to change resource
	access permissions of individual users, deactivate or delete accounts, reset user passwords, and edit user details.
	You can also add new users to Booked Scheduler. This is especially useful if self-registration is turned off.</p>

<h3>Reporting</h3>

<p>Reports are accessible to all application, group, resource and schedule administrators. When the currently logged in
	user has access to reporting features, they will see a Reports navigation item. Booked Scheduler comes with a set of
	Common Reports which can be viewed as a list of results, a chart, exported to CSV and printed. In addition, ad-hoc
	reports can be created from the Create New Report menu item. This also allows listing, charting, exporting and
	printing. In addition, custom reports can be saved and accessed again at a later time from the My Saved Reports menu
	item. Saved reports also have the ability to be emailed.</p>

<h3>Reservation Reminders</h3>

<p>Users can request that reminder emails are send prior to the beginning or end of a reservation. In order for this
	feature to function, $conf['settings']['enable.email'] and $conf['settings']['reservation']['enable.reminders'] must
	both be set to true. Also, a scheduled task must be configured on your server to execute
	/Booked Scheduler/Jobs/sendreminders.php</p>

<p>On Linux, a cron job can be used. The command to run is <span class="note">php</span> followed by the full path to
	Booked Scheduler/Jobs/sendreminders.php. The full path to sendreminders.php on this server is <span
			class="note">{$RemindersPath}</span>
</p>

<p>An example cron configuration might look like: <span class="note">* * * * * php {$RemindersPath}</span></p>

<p>If you have access to cPanel through a hosting provider, <a
			href="http://docs.cpanel.net/twiki/bin/view/AllDocumentation/CpanelDocs/CronJobs" target="_blank">setting up
		a
		cron job in cPanel</a> is straightforward. Either select the Every Minute option from the Common Settings menu,
	or
	enter * for minute, hour, day, month and weekday.</p>

<p>On Windows, <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows7/schedule-a-task" target="_blank">a scheduled task
		can be used</a>. The task must be configured to run every minute. The task to execute is php followed by the
	full

<h2>Plugins</h2>

<p>The following components are currently pluggable:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Authentication - Who is allowed to log in</li>
	<li>Authorization - What a user can do when you are logged in</li>
	<li>Permission - What resources a user has access to</li>
	<li>Pre Reservation - What happens before a reservation is booked</li>
	<li>Post Reservation - What happens after a reservation is booked</li>
</ul>

<p>
	To enable a plugin, set the value of the config setting to the name of the plugin folder. For example, to enable
	LDAP
	authentication, set
	$conf['settings']['plugins']['Authentication'] = 'Ldap';</p>

<p>Plugins may have their own configuration files. For LDAP, rename or copy
	/plugins/Authentication/Ldap/Ldap.config.dist to /plugins/Authentication/Ldap/Ldap.config and edit all values that
	are applicable to your environment.</p>

<h3>Installing Plugins</h3>

<p>To install a new plugin copy the folder to either the Authentication, Authorization and Permission directory. Then
	change either $conf['settings']['plugins']['Authentication'], $conf['settings']['plugins']['Authorization'] or
	$conf['settings']['plugins']['Permission'] in config.php to the name of that folder.</p>
